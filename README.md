# Using the Spotify API to Identify Trends in Top Hits
My final project for NYU Stern's Data Bootcamp class. 

This project was completed by Srishti Sanya in partial fulfilment of ECON-UB.0232, Data Bootcamp, Fall 2017. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project. In particular, I have:

Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own. The incorporation of the work of others--including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), or paraphrasing thereof-- has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text and the bibliography.

And I understand that:

Submitting the same or substantially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden.

I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for the project and course.


# Summary
The aim of this project was to see if there were any long term trends in the music that charts at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 based on their Spotify audio features. To do this, a dataset was created of every #1 song on the Billboard Hot 100, the dates at which each song charted at #1, and their relevant Spotify audio feautres. Various types of graphical analysis were conducted to further understand these trends.
